# DAI-2022-UDP-Orchestra

## Admin

- **You can work in groups of 2 students**.
- It is up to you if you want to fork this repo, or if you prefer to work in a private repo. However, you have to **use exactly the same directory structure for the validation procedure to work**.
- We expect that you will have more issues and questions than with other labs (because we have a left some questions open on purpose). Please ask your questions on Teams, so that everyone in the class can benefit from the discussion.
- ⚠️ You will have to send your GitHub URL, answer the questions and send the output log of the `validate.sh` script, which prove that your project is working [in this Google Form](https://forms.gle/6SM7cu4cYhNsRvqX8).

## Objectives

This lab has 4 objectives:

- The first objective is to **design and implement a simple application protocol on top of UDP**. It will be very similar to the protocol presented during the lecture (where thermometers were publishing temperature events in a multicast group and where a station was listening for these events).

- The second objective is to get familiar with several tools from **the JavaScript ecosystem**. You will implement two simple **Node.js** applications. You will also have to search for and use a couple of **npm modules** (i.e. third-party libraries).

- The third objective is to continue practicing with **Docker**. You will have to create 2 Docker images (they will be very similar to the images presented in class). You will then have to run multiple containers based on these images.

- Last but not least, the fourth objective is to **work with a bit less upfront guidance**, as compared with previous labs. This time, we do not provide a complete webcast to get you started, because we want you to search for information (this is a very important skill that we will increasingly train). Don't worry, we have prepared a fairly detailed list of tasks that will put you on the right track. If you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning, make sure to read this document carefully and to find answers to the questions asked in the tables. You will see that the whole thing will become more and more approachable.

## Requirements

In this lab, you will **write 2 small NodeJS applications** and **package them in Docker images**:

- the first app, **Musician**, simulates someone who plays an instrument in an orchestra. When the app is started, it is assigned an instrument (piano, flute, etc.). As long as it is running, every second it will emit a sound (well... simulate the emission of a sound: we are talking about a communication protocol). Of course, the sound depends on the instrument.

- the second app, **Auditor**, simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities. Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of **active** musicians. A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. Secondly, it must make this information available to you. Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.

### Instruments and sounds

The following table gives you the mapping between instruments and sounds. Please **use exactly the same string values** in your code, so that validation procedures can work.

| Instrument | Sound       |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `piano`    | `ti-ta-ti`  |
| `trumpet`  | `pouet`     |
| `flute`    | `trulu`     |
| `violin`   | `gzi-gzi`   |
| `drum`     | `boum-boum` |

### TCP-based protocol to be implemented by the Auditor application

- The auditor should include a TCP server and accept connection requests on port 2205.
- After accepting a connection request, the auditor must send a JSON payload containing the list of <u>active</u> musicians, with the following format (it can be a single line, without indentation):

```
[
  {
  	"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
  	"instrument" : "piano",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z"
  },
  {
  	"uuid" : "06dbcbeb-c4c8-49ed-ac2a-cd8716cbf2d3",
  	"instrument" : "flute",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:39:03.211Z"
  }
]
```

### What you should be able to do at the end of the lab

You should be able to start an **Auditor** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 dai/auditor
```

You should be able to connect to your **Auditor** container over TCP and see that there is no active musician.

```
$ telnet IP_ADDRESS_THAT_DEPENDS_ON_YOUR_SETUP 2205
[]
```

You should then be able to start a first **Musician** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d dai/musician piano
```

After this, you should be able to verify two points. Firstly, if you connect to the TCP interface of your **Auditor** container, you should see that there is now one active musician (you should receive a JSON array with a single element). Secondly, you should be able to use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP datagrams generated by the **Musician** container.

You should then be able to kill the **Musician** container, wait 5 seconds and connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor** container. You should see that there is now no active musician (empty array).

You should then be able to start several **Musician** containers with the following commands:

```
$ docker run -d dai/musician piano
$ docker run -d dai/musician flute
$ docker run -d dai/musician flute
$ docker run -d dai/musician drum
```

When you connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor**, you should receive an array of musicians that corresponds to your commands. You should also use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP trafic in your system.

| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Question | In a JavaScript program, if we have an object, how can we **serialize it in JSON**? |
|          | _With the function JSON.stringify(OBJECT)_                                          |
| Question | What is **npm**?                                                                    |
|          | _NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It allows you to install, update, and manage third-party libraries or modules in Node.js projects_ |
| Question | What is the `npm install` command and what is the purpose of the `--save` flag?     |
|          | _The npm install command is used to install packages from the npm registry. The packages can be installed locally or globally, depending on the options specified. <br /> The --save flag is used to automatically save the installed package(s) as a dependency in the project's package.json file. This way, if all the project's dependencies are installed when running npm install command_ |
| Question | How can we use the `https://www.npmjs.com/` web site?                               |
|          | _It is very usefull to search for module dependencies. It documents every version, etc. ..._ |
| Question | In JavaScript, how can we **generate a UUID** compliant with RFC4122?               |
|          | _By using uuid/v4 module <br/> `const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');` <br/> `uuidv4();`_ |
| Question | In Node.js, how can we execute a function on a **periodic** basis?                  |

| Question | In Node.js, how can we **emit UDP datagrams**?                                      |
|          | _You can emit UDP datagrams using the functions available in dgram official module <br/> `const socket = dgram.createSocket('udp4');` <br/> `socket.connect(protocol.PROTOCOL_PORT, protocol.PROTOCOL_MULTICAST_ADDRESS);` <br/> `socket.send(message);`_ |
| Question | In Node.js, how can we **access the command line arguments**?                       |
|          | _By using the `process.argv[argNum]` function._                                             |

| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Question | What is the purpose of the `ENTRYPOINT` statement in our Dockerfile?                |
|          | _ENTRYPOINT is used instead of CMD to pass the command line arguments to the container. It allows the container to run as a true executable._ |
| Question | How can we check that our running containers are effectively sending UDP datagrams? |
|          | _We can sniff traffic with tools such as tcpdump to see what's going on_            |

## Task 4: implement an "auditor" Node.js application

|          | _Each 5 seconds using a function described in the end of our auditor.js file that will remove inactive musicians from our data structure_ |
| Question | How do I implement a **simple TCP server** in Node.js?                                             |
|          | _By using the net package `const net = require('net');` `const tcpServer = net.createServer();` `tcpServer.listen(TCP_PORT);`_  |

## Task 5: package the "auditor" app in a Docker image

| #        | Topic                                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Question |Send us the log file of the validation script to show that everything is ok           |
|          | _[logfile](check.log)_                                                        |

## Constraints

Please be careful to adhere to the specifications in this document, and in particular

- the Docker image names
- the names of instruments and their sounds
- the TCP PORT number

Also, we have prepared two directories, where you should place your two `Dockerfile` with their dependent files.

### Validation

Have a look at the `validate.sh` script located in the top-level directory. This script automates part of the validation process for your implementation (it will gradually be expanded with additional operations and assertions). As soon as you start creating your Docker images (i.e. creating your Dockerfiles), you should **try to run it** to see if your implementation is correct. When you submit your project in the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/6SM7cu4cYhNsRvqX8), the script will be used for grading, together with other criteria.
